# makemore

**makemore** is a rewrite of Andrej Karpathy's [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) repository with some improvements.

**makemore** takes text as input, and generates more text as output. Under the hood, it is an autoregressive character-level language model, with a wide choice of models from bigrams all the way to a Transformers. For example, we can feed it a database of names, and makemore will generate cool baby name ideas that all sound name-like, but are not already existing names. Or if we feed it a database of company names then we can generate new ideas for a name of a company. Or we can just feed it valid scrabble words and generate english-like babble.

This is not meant to be too heavyweight library with a billion switches and knobs. It is one hackable file, and is mostly intended for educational purposes. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is the only requirement.

Current implementation follows a few key papers:

- Bigram (one character predicts the next one with a lookup table of counts)
- MLP, following [Bengio et al. 2003](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf)
- CNN, following [DeepMind WaveNet 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499) (in progress...)
- RNN, following [Mikolov et al. 2010](https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/speech/publi/2010/mikolov_interspeech2010_IS100722.pdf)
- LSTM, following [Graves et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850)
- GRU, following [Kyunghyun Cho et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1259)
- Transformer, following [Vaswani et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
